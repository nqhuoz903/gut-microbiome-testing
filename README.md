## FAQ

**Do microbiome tests require ongoing sample collection or just one test?**
Most platforms require a single stool sample to generate initial results and recommendations, though companies like Floré and Ombre offer subscription models for ongoing monitoring as your microbiome changes with dietary and lifestyle interventions. DNA-based services like GenoPalate need just one test since genetics remain constant, while microbiome-focused tests benefit from periodic retesting to track improvements.

**How long does it take to receive results after sending samples?**
Turnaround times vary significantly—Viome typically delivers results within 2-3 weeks, BIOHM takes approximately 34 days, Thorne requires 5-6 weeks, and Tiny Health returns results in 2-3 weeks. Faster results don't necessarily indicate less thorough analysis, as different sequencing methods and lab workflows affect processing times.

**Can microbiome testing diagnose medical conditions or replace doctor visits?**
These tests are wellness tools, not diagnostic medical tests—they identify microbial imbalances and provide health insights but cannot diagnose diseases or replace professional medical care. Always consult healthcare providers about serious health issues or before making major supplement changes based on test results, and use microbiome data to guide conversations with your doctor rather than self-treating.
